        <h1>The Four Seagulls of the Apocalypse</h1>
        <p>The Four Seagulls of the Apocalypse are the stages of a seagull's anger according to the New Avian Testament.</p> 
        <p>Each of the seagull's emotions represent how angry it is in four phases from least hostile to most hostile: who, whom, whomst, whomst've.</p><br>

        <h3>who</h3>
        <p><i>Its initial form, the seagull starts to judge you slowly or it simply just doesn't acknowledge your very existence.</i></p><br>

        <h3>whom</h3>
        <p><i>At this stage, the seagull starts to despise you and will react a bit towards you. Proceed with caution.</i></p><br>

        <h3>whomst</h3>
        <p><i>This is when the seagull starts to get pretty pissed off as it expresses an attitude by tilting its head back to inhale in preparation of unleashing all of its pent up emotion.</i></p><br>
